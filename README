News::NNTP
======================

News::NNTP is an NNTP client module.

This is a low-level interface, designed not to get in your way.  You don't
need to constantly refer back to the documentation to find just the right
invocation for the NNTP command you want; you just send NNTP commands and
get back the responses.

The module tries to handle dropped connections (from a server idle timeout,
for example) by transparently re-establishing the connection and restoring
any necessary state, including authentication.

Large response bodies (LIST ACTIVE, or XOVER, for example) can be handled as
they come off the wire, and without storing the entire response in-core if
doing so isn't necessary for the application.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

TESTS

A test script is included that is run by "make test".  However, it needs
a news server to connect to.  You can add your information to the script
itself (t/nntp.t) or pass it in the environment variables NNTPSERVER,
NNTPUSER (if a username is required), NNTPPASS, and NNTPPORT (default
is 119).

  env NNTPSERVER=news.example.com make test

DEPENDENCIES

Requires a recent Perl 5.8.x.

There are no non-core dependences.

I developed this module on Mac OS X and have tested and deployed it
on FreeBSD.
